    <h2>How Much Should I Spend on a Car?</h2>
<p>There are five general rules financial experts suggest when buying a car. Each rule has its own strengths. The right rule for you will come down to your current financial situation.</p>
<h3>20/4/10 Rule</h3>
<p>While making a low down payment (<a href="/learn/how-to-get-car-with-no-down-payment" data-di-id="di-id-34384374-86fdcfac">or none at all</a>) may sound better in the short term, the 20/4/10 rule accelerates your loan payoff time because the large down payment means you’ll borrow less. Plus, a shorter loan term means you pay less in interest over the life of the loan.</p>
<p><b>How it works: </b>The 20/4/10 rule involves making a 20% down payment, financing the vehicle for 4 years or less, and ensuring your total monthly vehicle costs are less than 10% of your gross monthly income.</p>
<h3>15% Rule</h3>
<p><a href="/learn/true-cost-of-car-ownership" data-di-id="di-id-1d09c0a7-10c44c07">Car costs can add up</a> beyond that number shown on the window, including fuel, insurance, and maintenance. The 15% rule keeps the purchase price of your car low so you’ll still have money for upkeep costs. It's ideal for the careful, savings-minded spender.</p>
<p><b>How it works:</b> The 15% rule states that you should spend no more than 15% of your monthly take-home pay on a car purchase.</p>
<h3>20% Rule</h3>
<p>The 20% rule is just like the 15% rule, with a little more room to spend. It’s a great middle ground for those who need a little more out of their vehicles.</p>
<p><b>How it works:</b> The 20% rule suggests that your total car costs—both monthly payments and upkeep expenses—should not exceed 20% of your monthly take-home pay.</p>
<h3>36% Rule</h3>
<p>If you’re looking for a more general approach, you might like the 36% rule. This rule goes by the preset that no more than 36% of your gross monthly income (income after taxes) should be spent on debt, period.</p>
<p><b>How it works:</b> To find your car-buying budget, add up all your monthly debts, including your mortgage/rent, credit cards, and student loans. Subtract this from your gross monthly income and you’ll have a budget that ensures your monthly car payments are manageable.</p>
<h3>Half-Your-Annual-Salary Rule</h3>
<p>Some car-buying experts suggest you can spend up to half your annual salary on a car and its associated costs.</p>
<p><b>How it works:</b> If you make $50,000 per year, you can spend up to $25,000 on your down payment, loan payments, fuel, insurance, and maintenance. (If your household has more than one vehicle, be aware that your second vehicle’s costs count toward that 50% as well.)</p>
<p>If your home is paid off and you have no other debt, this may be a good rule to follow. However, you should examine your household <a href="/learn/5-proven-budgeting-strategies" data-di-id="di-id-3452923c-3a4b1e1e">budget</a> carefully and consider your other expenses before committing so much of your income to one purchase.</p>
<h2>Hidden Costs of Buying a Car</h2>
<p>When buying a car, there are hidden costs to consider. Learning about these costs now can help you possibly counter them down the road.</p>
<h3>Fees and Costs That Could Potentially Be Waived</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>Dealership Fee: </b>This covers the dealer's costs to get your car ready to leave the lot. If your car has to be delivered from the manufacturer, there can be a fee for that, too (also known as a destination fee).</li>
<li><b>Financing Fees:</b> The act of<b> </b>taking out a loan sometimes requires a fee. This<b> </b>charge is based on the interest rate of the loan.</li>
<li><b>Advertising Costs: </b>Manufacturers sometimes charge dealers an advertising fee.<b> </b>Some dealers might add their own advertising fee to the one from the manufacturer.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Fees and Costs that Likely Cannot Be Waived</h3>
<p>These non-negotiable fees are often bundled into what's known as the out-the-door price.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Documentation Fee: </b>This fee is required by law in some states. It's a charge administered for prepping paperwork, including the sales contract. <a href="https://www.edmunds.com/car-buying/what-fees-should-you-pay.html#chart" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" data-di-id="di-id-3ecdcde2-e0993098">See where your state stands</a>.<b></b></li>
<li><b>Vehicle Title and Registration Fees: </b>These fees cover assigning the car title and registering your car at your local department of motor vehicles (DMV) and also <a href="https://drivinglaws.aaa.com/tag/title-and-registration-fees/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" data-di-id="di-id-1d09c0a7-48281694">differ by state</a>. <b></b></li>
<li><b>State and Local Sales Tax: </b><a href="https://worldpopulationreview.com/state-rankings/car-sales-tax-by-state" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" data-di-id="di-id-fdbb740e-eda97c66">Some states enforce a sales tax</a> when you buy a new car (the amount varies by state).<b> </b>If you buy a car out of state, you'll most likely pay the sales tax issued by the state you live in, since that's where you'll also register it. <a href="https://www.factorywarrantylist.com/car-tax-by-state.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" data-di-id="di-id-63dad133-fe0cb08f">Local sales tax charges</a> vary by city and county.<b></b></li>
</ul>
<p>Bottom line, keep the conversation on the out-the-door price before committing to a deal.</p>
<h2>Go by Your Golden Rules</h2>
<p>Determining how much you should spend on a car is your first move in the car-buying game.</p>
<p>And you'll be better set to ace it playing by <i>your</i> rules:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do your prep work by setting and sticking to your budget</li>
<li>Find a spending strategy that works for you</li>
<li>Keep the out-the-door price in focus</li>

<p>Few experiences are as exhilarating as sliding behind the wheel of a new vehicle and calling it your own. Here are some upsides to being the first titleholder of a car:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>No previous history</li>
<li>Longer warranty coverage</li>
<li>Enhanced safety features</li>
<li>Newer technology</li>
</ul>
<h3>No Previous History</h3>
<p>The biggest advantage of buying a new car vs. a used car is its clean slate. With no previous owner, you don't have to worry whether the car was:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mistreated or improperly maintained</li>
<li>Involved in accidents</li>
<li>Plagued by underlying mechanical or electrical issues</li>
</ul>
<p>Since a new car has virtually no miles on the odometer, it will be in prime mechanical condition with no wear and tear on any of the major systems or components. Plus, the interior will be pristine.</p>
<h3>Longer Warranty Coverage</h3>
<p>Most new cars feature a bumper-to-bumper <a href="/learn/how-gap-warranties-help-save" data-di-id="di-id-96545039-3af49d85">warranty</a> from the manufacturer for at least three years or 36,000 miles. As the name implies, this type of warranty will pay to replace all but a select few parts and systems on the vehicle if issues arise.</p>
<p>Powertrain warranties, which also come with the vehicle, cover the engine, transmission, axles, and other mechanical components. These warranties generally last five years or 60,000 miles but occasionally extend to as long as 10 years or 100,000 miles.</p>
<h3>Enhanced Safety Features</h3>
<p>Peace of mind is a beautiful thing, especially when it comes to a vehicle. Even base models have better safety features than most older vehicles.</p>
<p>Common safety equipment on newer cars includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Three-point seat belts, which restrain occupants across their lap and shoulder</li>
<li>Airbags, including side-impact airbags and curtains</li>
<li>Electronic stability control to help maintain stability if you start to lose control of the vehicle</li>
<li>Backup cameras to reduce the chances of crashes while in reverse</li>
<li>Blindspot detection to monitor for vehicles in adjacent lanes</li>
</ul>
<h3>Newer Technology</h3>
<p>Cars have come a long way since the days of AM-only radios, window crank handles, and little more than a speedometer and gas gauge on the dashboard. Today's cars typically boast such tech-based features as:</p>
<ul>
<li>LCD displays</li>
<li>Power windows and door locks</li>
<li>Entertainment and navigation systems</li>
<li>Multi-zone climate control</li>
<li>Wi-Fi compatibility</li>
</ul>
<p>The list of standard and optional amenities for vehicles grows daily. So, if you're a techie or auto fanatic — or both — you can get the best of both worlds in a new vehicle.</p>    </div>

</section></div><div id="cons-buying-new-car" class="learning-center-article__rich-text">   <h2>Cons of Buying a New Car</h2>
<p>There's nothing like the smell of a new car, but that scent will fade long before you finish making payments on a vehicle. Here are some of the disadvantages of buying new:</p>
<ul>
<li>Higher purchase price</li>
<li>Depreciation</li>
<li>Higher insurance premiums</li>
<li>Maintenance and repair costs</li>
</ul>
<h3>Higher Purchase Price</h3>
<p>When deciding between a new car or a used car, the biggest disadvantage to buying a new vehicle is the price. The <a href="https://www.experian.com/blogs/ask-experian/what-is-the-average-price-for-a-new-car/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" data-di-id="di-id-62aaba16-11ddeefc">average cost of a new car</a> is more than $38,000, and recent challenges created by the pandemic and other supply chain issues are driving prices even higher.</p>
<p>When you buy a vehicle, most states also charge a <a href="https://www.findthebestcarprice.com/car-sales-tax-by-state/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" data-di-id="di-id-d886489f-19a4fb01">sales tax</a> based on a percentage of the purchase price. Taxes can add anywhere from a few hundred to several thousand dollars to the final cost, depending on the state where you live.</p>
<h3>Depreciation</h3>
<p>Regardless of the make or model, every new vehicle loses roughly 9% to 11% of its total value the moment you drive it off the lot. Plus, its value will <a href="https://www.ramseysolutions.com/saving/car-depreciation#:~:text=After%20one%20year%2C%20your%20car,around%2060%25%20of%20its%20value." rel="nofollow" target="_blank" data-di-id="di-id-d886489f-4d2da0df">depreciate</a> approximately 15% to 20% annually over the first five years.</p>
<p>Most experts agree that the average new vehicle will only be worth 40% of its purchase price after 60 months. Any way you look at it, new car ownership — particularly in the early stages — doesn't yield impressive returns in terms of "traditional" investing.</p>
<h3>Higher Insurance Premiums</h3>
<p>In general, new cars are more expensive to insure than used cars. However, this can vary depending on the make, model, and trim level.</p>
<p>Beyond the straight-up value of the vehicle, insurance companies consider these factors when pricing a policy:</p>
<ul>
<li>How likely a car is to be stolen</li>
<li>The cost to repair if it's damaged</li>
<li>How safe it is to operate</li>
</ul>
<p>This means new cars are typically more expensive to insure.<br>
That said, with better safety features and (sometimes) lower costs of <a href="/learn/repair-or-replace-old-car" data-di-id="di-id-b81e4156-c39705e4">repair</a>, it can be cheaper to insure some new cars. Check with your insurance agent before you decide.</p>
<h3>Maintenance and Repair Costs</h3>
<p>Sooner or later, the warranty on your new vehicle will expire. When it does, you'll be responsible for the full price of maintenance and repairs.</p>
<p>Whether it's replacing tires, repairing safety equipment, or just taking care of general wear and tear, it can be expensive to maintain a new vehicle. Consider it the not-so-hidden cost of all the bells and whistles featured on new cars and trucks.</p>

<p>At the end of the day, the primary advantages associated with buying a used car are all tied to money. They include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lower purchase price</li>
<li>Cheaper insurance rates</li>
<li>Reduced depreciation</li>
<li>Lower fees and taxes</li>
</ul>
<h3>Lower Purchase Price</h3>
<p>Used cars usually cost less to buy than new cars. Depending on the year, make, model, mileage, and condition, you can save thousands of dollars purchasing a used car or truck.</p>
<p>That said, many popular makes and models retain their resale value well, which can make it difficult to find a good deal on a used vehicle. If you're not going to save a considerable amount of money buying used, a new car may be a better option.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Cheaper Insurance Rates</h3>
<p>Insurance rates are determined by a variety of factors, including the vehicle's value. Since a used car generally costs less to repair or replace, insurance rates are typically lower. This can save you thousands of dollars over time.</p>
<h3>Reduced Depreciation</h3>
<p>If you buy a vehicle that's more than five years old, it's already taken the major depreciation hit that comes in the first few years of new car ownership. The rate of depreciation continues to slow year over year after that, making it easier to recoup much of the investment you have in your car should you choose to sell it in the future.</p>
<h3>Lower Fees and Taxes</h3>
<p>Similar to insurance premiums, your car's value determines the amount you pay in vehicle registration fees and property taxes. Both are lower with used cars and will continue to decrease annually the longer you own your car.&nbsp;</p>    </div>

</section></div><div id="cons-buying-used-car" class="learning-center-article__rich-text">   <h2>Cons of Buying a Used Vehicle</h2>
<p>In a perfect world, you could quickly find the exact make and model used vehicle you wanted — impeccably maintained, in your favorite color, and at a great price — with very few miles.</p>
<p>Of course, neither the world nor used car buying is perfect. This leads us to some of the disadvantages of purchasing used:</p>
<ul>
<li>Previous history</li>
<li>Less reliability over time</li>
<li>Less convenient buying process</li>
<li>Fewer financing options</li>
</ul>
<h3>Previous History</h3>
<p>There's always a level of risk involved when buying a used car. Services like <a href="https://www.carfax.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" data-di-id="di-id-493674fa-7e7bca34">Carfax</a> and <a href="https://www.autocheck.com/vehiclehistory/?siteID=0" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" data-di-id="di-id-5b98f219-1eaa49b9">Autocheck</a> provide vehicle history reports that offer some degree of assurance.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, even the most accurate vehicle history can't paint a full picture of how the previous owner(s) treated and maintained the vehicle. That's a gamble you take when you opt for used.</p>
<h3>Less Reliability Over Time</h3>
<p>It's a simple fact: vehicles break down over time. So, it stands to reason that the more mileage and wear and tear a car has on it, the closer it is to a trip to the repair shop. Without the benefit of a warranty to help cut the cost, the money you save buying a used car might be sacrificed in reliability.</p>
<h3>Less Convenient Buying Process</h3>
<p>Buying a used vehicle usually requires more legwork than purchasing new. Rather than simply picking out a model you want in a color you like, you need to do a decent amount of <a href="/learn/how-online-car-buying-works" data-di-id="di-id-5b9a4354-a3062e0c">online research</a> before visiting a dealership. This includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Finding out as much as you can about the previous owner(s)</li>
<li>Scouring history reports</li>
<li>Determining the vehicle's value</li>
<li>Comparing prices</li>
<li>Setting up a test drive</li>
<li>Arranging an inspection by a mechanic</li>
<li>Reviewing your <a href="/learn/how-do-i-improve-my-credit-score" data-di-id="di-id-4b8739b9-ea05091b">credit</a></li>
<li>Lining up payment options</li>
</ul>
<p>Bottom line: You shouldn't rush a vehicle purchase, particularly when you're buying used.</p>
<h3>Fewer Financing Options</h3>
<p>All things being equal, it's generally more difficult to finance a used car than a new car. The reason? Lenders have a harder time determining the value of a used car.</p>
<p>A vehicle's value plays a huge role in financing because it serves as <a href="/learn/secured-vs-unsecured-loans" data-di-id="di-id-95ec28fc-8569822a">collateral for the loan.</a> If you were to <a href="/learn/what-does-it-mean-to-default-on-a-loan" data-di-id="di-id-b40ea4bd-a6fa3404">default on your loan</a>, the lender could seize the vehicle, but then they'd be left with a repossessed car that might be tough to sell in order to recoup their investment.</p>
<p>That's not to say credit unions, banks, online lenders, and many dealerships won't write loans for used car purchases. However, you may pay higher interest rates for a used car than a new car.</p>

<div id="certified-pre-owned-option" class="learning-center-article__rich-text">   <h2>The Certified Pre-Owned Option</h2>
<p>Spend any amount of time researching cars and you'll invariably run across models deemed <a href="https://www.edmunds.com/certified-cars/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" data-di-id="di-id-624582d4-cc0a4a9a">Certified Pre-Owned</a> (CPO). This is an automaker-backed certification assigned to late-model, low-mileage vehicles with clean history reports (i.e., no accidents, liens, or <a href="/learn/everything-you-need-to-know-about-car-titles" data-di-id="di-id-28c8ec42-9fdaddd1">branded titles</a>) that have received multipoint inspections and, if needed, some refurbishing.</p>
<p>Typically, CPO cars are sold by dealerships of the same brand. Other benefits often include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Extended warranty coverage</li>
<li>Discount financing offers</li>
<li>Roadside assistance</li>
<li>Additional perks such as buyback protection and satellite radio subscriptions (limited time)</li>
</ul>
<p>If you're on the fence about buying new or used, a CPO vehicle might be a good compromise. You'll get the peace of mind that comes with a thoroughly inspected automobile that's backed by a warranty from the manufacturer. Plus, CPO cars have already taken the major depreciation hit.</p>
<p>Keep in mind, however, that the advantages of CPO come at a price. Generally, you can expect a CPO vehicle to cost as much as 20% more than a non-CPO vehicle.</p>    </div>
<div id="new-car-vs-used-car" class="learning-center-article__rich-text">   <h2>New Car vs. Used Car: 3 Factors to Consider</h2>
<p>Whether you ultimately opt for a new car or a used car, your journey should begin with some due diligence. Here are three things to think about before you buy.</p>
<h3>1. How Much You Can Spend</h3>
<p>You need to determine <a href="/learn/how-much-should-i-spend-on-a-car" data-di-id="di-id-49d6b184-2d7a4ac3">how much to spend on your car</a>. One of the best ways to do this is to use a <a href="/calculators/auto-loan-calculators" data-di-id="di-id-1d774299-3274cbee">car loan calculator</a> to understand how much payments would be based on the length of a loan you might obtain, the interest rate, amount you put down on the vehicle, and other factors.</p>
<h3>2. The Total Cost of Ownership</h3>
<p>The cost of owning a car is far greater than the price printed on the window sticker. Before buying, you should account for what you'll likely pay for insurance, gas, maintenance, fees, and taxes. Also, remember some vehicles — particularly luxury models — are more expensive to own and maintain.</p>
<h3>3. Resale Value</h3>
<p>If you're looking to recoup most of the cost you spent to purchase the vehicle, a used car is likely your best option. As mentioned above, depreciation affects the resale value of a new car the moment you drive it off the lot. In some cases, you may even be able to sell a used car for almost the same amount you paid after a few years.</p>    </div>

</section></div><div id="alternatives-purchasing" class="learning-center-article__rich-text">   <h2>Alternatives to Purchasing</h2>
<p>Now that you have a better understanding of the advantages and disadvantages of buying new or used, there's one more thing to consider: alternatives to buying. Instead of trying to buy a vehicle outright, you could choose to lease or, perhaps, sign up for a car subscription program.</p>
<h3>Vehicle Leasing</h3>
<p><a href="/learn/lease-vs-buy-new-car" data-di-id="di-id-e0f08793-46aa54b">Leasing a car</a> allows you to keep and drive that car for a set period (usually 36 to 48 months) without having to buy it. You're typically required to make a down payment, but monthly payments are generally lower than for a loan. When your lease period ends, you have the option of turning in the vehicle or purchasing it at a predetermined amount, which is outlined in the lease contract.</p>
<h3>Car Subscriptions</h3>
<p>Still relatively new, a <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/best-car-subscription-services-5112003" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" data-di-id="di-id-abe43d04-cac5666d">car subscription service</a> allows you to “rent” a vehicle on a short-term basis for a monthly fee. A subscription, which is typically offered in increments of one, six, or 12 months, often includes registration, maintenance, roadside assistance, and liability insurance. Generally, you also have the freedom to swap out your vehicle to a different model each month.</p>
<h2>Your Next Steps</h2>
<p>At the end of the day, buying any vehicle — whether a new car or a used car — is a big financial decision that's influenced by numerous factors, including your lifestyle and personal budget.</p>
<p>If you do your research, spend within your means, and choose wisely, you can enjoy rolling down the highway of life for miles (and years) on end.</p>    </div>

                                  <p>Buying a car can be like preparing for a road trip — you need to research your route and find the best way to get to your destination. Making mistakes is inevitable, as there's a lot to consider, but awareness is key.</p>
<h2>Common Car Buying Mistakes</h2>
<p>Here are seven of the most common mistakes people tend to make when buying a car and expert insight on how you can avoid them.</p>
<h3>1. Not Taking Advantage of Rebates or Certificates &nbsp;</h3>
<p>Rebates and money-off certificates can accelerate your car buying savings, but do you know how to find them? Some manufacturers encourage their employees to readily hand these out. Talking to friends can be a quick, easy way to find a connection with access to these types of savings.</p>
<p>Navigating through manufacturer's websites or sites such as <a href="https://www.kbb.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" data-di-id="di-id-be304223-fa231584">Kelley Blue Book</a> can help you find monthly specials on certain models as well. You can also get in touch with dealerships to scout out available car rebates and lease incentives.</p>
<h3>2. Overlooking Resale Value</h3>
<p>From reliability to style, many factors may be on your mind as you shop for a car but thinking about resale value might not be so obvious to you. Resale value is how much money a car owner will likely get when selling or trading in a car.</p>
<p>Here are some factors that affect resale value:</p>
<ul>
<li>Condition, make, model, mileage, and age all weigh in when it comes to the resale value of a car, but a well-maintained car no older than three years should help you land your target price when you're ready to sell or trade.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Brand recognition and how popular a vehicle is can also impact resale value, but these factors can shift, depending on <a href="https://www.motorbiscuit.com/best-selling-cars-of-all-time/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" data-di-id="di-id-d3d79a1b-3df50514">consumer preferences</a>, gas prices, and more.</li>
</ul>
<p>When it's time to sell or trade in, remember to research the <a href="https://www.kbb.com/car-values/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" data-di-id="di-id-be304223-15f2f0c4">value of your car</a> to ensure you get what your car is worth.</p>
<h3>3. Neglecting to Buy a Car Online</h3>
<p>Have you ever thought about <a href="/learn/why-you-should-buy-your-car-online" data-di-id="di-id-b1bab316-34f9f174">buying a car online</a>? During the pandemic in 2020, online car buying was, in some cases, the only way to purchase a car. Now, buying a car online is a great option to consider.</p>
<p>Online car buying websites play up the perks of the refined, online customer experience they offer — meaning no dealership, high-pressure sales associates, or commission-based motive. Plus, many of those sites offer new and used options, trade-in quotes, and more.</p>
<h3>4. Forgetting About Deals Through Affiliated Groups and Credit Unions</h3>
<p>Certain warehouse clubs, organizations, and credit unions have programs that offer generous <a href="/member-discounts#auto" data-di-id="di-id-be304223-fa00788e">member discounts</a> on cars.</p>
<p>For example, affiliated groups such as <a href="https://www.aarp.org/benefits-discounts/all/aarp-auto-buying-program/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" data-di-id="di-id-3321b03b-657d936b">AARP</a> and <a href="https://www.costco.com/auto-program-services.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" data-di-id="di-id-3452923c-d37a5bcb">Costco</a> have resources and tools to set members up with the best car buying deals. Many credit unions also provide member-exclusive rebates for the purchase or lease of select vehicles.</p>                               </div>

                                  <h3>5. Bypassing Nearly New Cars</h3>
<p>Certain things are at their best when ever-so-slightly worn in (think shoes and jeans). This concept translates to nearly new cars too.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.daveramsey.com/blog/car-depreciation" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" data-di-id="di-id-8c21adf7-2d3652d7">New cars lose around 20% of their value</a> in the first year of ownership, whereas nearly new cars will have already lost some value during the first few months of use — meaning they'll have a lower price tag and will lose less value down the road.</p>
<p>Here's how nearly new cars are generally classified:</p>
<ul>
<li>Under three years of age and no more than 25,000 miles</li>
<li>Only one previous owner or many have been used as a test model</li>
<li>Lower mileage and less wear and tear</li>
</ul>
<p>Another factor that makes nearly new cars so appealing is that you can shop for them at dealerships <i>or</i> online.</p>
<h3>6. Overlooking Total Cost of Ownership (TCO)</h3>
<p>Figuring in money for a tip is probably second nature when you're dining out at a restaurant. Likewise, try to make a habit of accounting for related expenses when shopping for a car.</p>
<p>Considering TCO helps buyers plan for longer-term expenses because the total cost of ownership goes beyond the purchase price of the car. TCO can include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Insurance, regular maintenance, as-needed repairs, fuel</li>
<li>Financing (don't forget the down payment and interest)</li>
<li>Optional features like an <a href="/learn/how-gap-warranties-help-save" data-di-id="di-id-d0727547-6b96d13f">extended warranty</a> or credit insurance</li>
</ul>
<p>There are also potential fees to look out for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dealership fee (if buying at a dealership)</li>
<li>Destination fee (if your car has to be delivered from the manufacturer)</li>
<li>Vehicle title and registration fees</li>
<li>State and local sales taxes</li>
<li>Documentation fee (required in <a href="https://www.edmunds.com/car-buying/what-fees-should-you-pay.html#chart" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" data-di-id="di-id-be304223-c7577259">some states</a> for preparing paperwork)</li>
</ul>
<h3>7. Not Being Aware of Online Tools</h3>
<p>The right tools can make almost any experience, including car buying, easier and even fun. Certain online tools can make you aware of your options, from vehicle preference to financing.</p>
<p>Here a few tools that can be helpful:</p>
<p><b>Vehicle Preference Quizzes: </b>There are <a href="http://www.whichcarisrightforme.com/Quiz/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" data-di-id="di-id-b1bab316-a800e7dd">online car quizzes</a> available to help you find the perfect vehicle based on your price range, family situation, and more. If you're unsure what you're looking for, this is a good place to start.</p>
<p><b>Loan Payment Calculators: </b>Using a <a href="/calculators/auto-loan-calculators" data-di-id="di-id-b1bab316-af3f6e74">payment calculator</a> will give you an estimate of how much your monthly payments will be based on your loan details. This is a great way to find out how much you can afford.</p>
<p><b>Car Buying Service: </b>A <a href="/auto/car-buying-service" data-di-id="di-id-b1bab316-b7c55f1f">car buying service</a> can help you find the right new or used car. You decide what kind of car you're looking for, and the tool will locate the best matches near you. Some car buying services even offer special discounts.</p>
<h2>Enjoy the Ride</h2>
<p>After doing your research and using the most effective tools and resources to explore your options, finding your final destination — the best car for you — can be exciting and rewarding. Just remember to avoid those seven mistakes so you head in the right direction.</p>                               </div>
